# Guessing-Game

This is a game I learned how to build with JavaScript.
It gives the player a chance to guess the number that the computer is thinking of between 1 and 6. 
Then it outputs, "You guessed right" if the player gets it
If not it outputs, "Sorry the number was " + randomNumber(the computer was thinking of)!
